# PROBLEM: Writing coding interview questions hasn't made me rich. Maybe
# trading Apple stocks will.
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# I have an array stock_prices_yesterday where:
#
# * The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
# * The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
# * For example, the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, so stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500.
#
# Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit I could have made
# from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.
#
# No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the
# same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).

# Mapped to a Hash but that takes up more memory.
